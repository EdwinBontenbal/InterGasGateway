# InterGasGateway
Hardware/Software to monitor a Intergas boiler over rs232 to Domotica Software


# Good to know
- The Intergas boiler can deliver a limited amount of current. If the a certain current level is exceded the boiler will turn off. It is possible to power the IntergasGW completly via the boiler.
- Intergas has it's own software for monitoring the boiler. You can download the original software at this link (https://www.intergas-verwarming.nl/zakelijk/download-ids-software/). The only thing you have to do is registrar yourself. The software was extremly usefull during the development of the arduino software.


# Help needed
I own a intergas boiler of type ic2 so I was able to develop the arduino parse code for the ic2 telegrams. I want to add and test also the ic3 telegrams therefor I need someone to test for me the arduino code.
