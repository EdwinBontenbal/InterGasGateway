# Good to know
- The Intergas boiler can deliver a limited amount of current. If the a certain current level is exceded the boiler will turn off. It is possible to power the IntergasGW completly via the boiler.
- Intergas has it's own software for monitoring the boiler. You can download the original software at this link (https://www.intergas-verwarming.nl/zakelijk/download-ids-software/). The only thing you have to do is registrar yourself. The software was extremly usefull during the development of the arduino software.
